testJobs:
  - name: job1
    repeat: true
    interval: 100
    steps:
      - step: authenticate to get new token
        testData:
          userName: "remoteadmin"
          password: "password@123"

      - step: reserve use of calculator for next "100" milliseconds

      - step: logoff the old token

  - name: job2
    steps:
      - step: the calculator is powered on
      - step: the all clear button is pressed
    node: Node2

setupSteps:
  - step: Given the calculator is powered on
    node: Node1

scenarioSetupSteps:
  - step: When the all clear button is pressed
    node: Node2
  - step: Then the calculator should display "0"
    node: Node1

testScenarios:
  - name: Scenario1
    probability: 0.5
    executionSteps:
      - step: When the button "2" is pressed
        node: Node2
      - step: And the button "+" is pressed
        node: Node1
      - step: And the button "3" is pressed
        node: Node2
      - step: And the button "=" is pressed
        node: Node1
      - step: And the calculator should display "5"
        node: Node2

  - name: Scenario2
    probability: 0.5
    executionSteps:
      - step: When a binary operation is perfomed on the calculator
        testData:
          operand1: 200
          operation: "/"
          operand2: 800
        node: Node1
      - step: And the calculator should display "0.25"
        node: Node2

scenarioTearDownSteps:
  - step: Then dummy teardown step
    node: Node1

tearDownSteps:
  - step: Then the calculator is powered off
    node: Node2
